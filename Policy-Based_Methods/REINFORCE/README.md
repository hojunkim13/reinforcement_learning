# REINFORCE

In this notebook we will train REINFORCE with OpenAI Gym's Cartpole environment and learn how to use Monte Carlo Policy Gradients to solve a classic control task.

### Instructions
Open REINFORCE.ipynb to see an implementation of REINFORCE (also known as Monte Carlo Policy Gradients) with OpenAI Gym's Cartpole environment.

Try to change the parameters in the notebook, to see if you can get the agent to train faster!

### Table of contents:
- REINFORCE.ipynb - this is an implementation of REINFORCE algorithm, also known as Monte Carlo Policy Gradients, with OpenAI Gym's Cartpole environment.
